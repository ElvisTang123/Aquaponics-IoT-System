# Aquponics-IoT-System

# Project Introduction
Nowadays, more and more people are having busy and overwhelming lifestyles. Thus, having pets like a tank of fish becomes a great way to release the pressure from daily life. However, due to the busyness and lack of time, people might lose patience in taking care of the fish tank. Hence, having an IoT system that could tell you the real-time data of your fish tank would be truly valuable. What could be better? In this project, we aim to build an aquaponics IoT system that can not only monitor the status of the fish tank but also use the collected data for further actions, such as reusing the tank water to irrigate the plants.<br />

# Accomplishments
* Created the multimeter’s AC/DC interface on Realterm through USART, USART’s interrupts.
* Calculated input signals’ Vpp and Vrms through sampling its voltages via ADC interrupt.
* Calculated the time interval between each ADC interrupt according to the frequency of the input signal to avoid over-sampling or under-sampling.
* Calculated the frequency of the input signal based on the interval between the two consecutive rising edges of the square wave that is generated by the comparator and the edges are captured by the timer’s interrupts.
* Generated the required square wave by configuring the DAC output value as the average voltage of the input signal and setting it as the reference voltage of the comparator.
